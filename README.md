# gui-tic-tac-toe
## Intro
This is a basic tic-tac-toe game to help me gain experience with creating GUI applications and as a challenge to create
a working project in a short amount of time. The GUIs are created using the Java Swing toolkit. I was able to get a
minimum viable product within 6 hours. 

## Improvements
Right now, the opponent (CPU) will randomly choose spots to play. In the future, there should be more logic added to
create a more sophisticated opponent (with possible difficulty levels) that can block the player from winning and 
choose more strategic spots. Additionally, more GUI components could be added such as to prompt the user to restart the 
game or end when there has been a winner.
